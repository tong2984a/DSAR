# 3 short demo of open source tools, followed by 1 of our own
- [demo-opensource-dsar.mp4](demo-opensource-dsar.mp4)
   - a web portal for managing data subject access requests; it has a dashboard, user access controls, and an api specification that is largely about request flows among partners; it lacks decision making support in terms of receiving, handling and responding to a request
- [demo-opensource-cookie1.mp4](demo-opensource-cookie1.mp4)
   - a cookie manager may not be the first thing on your mind, but personal data may include ip addresses, cookies, session id, etc. The DO NOT SELL attribute may also be within scope of regulations applicable to Zerion's customers. We can discuss later.
- [demo-opensource-cookie2.mp4](demo-opensource-cookie2.mp4)
   - another cookie manager that showcases more tracking parameters that may fall within scope of applicable regulations.
- [demo-prototype.mp4](demo-prototype.mp4)
   - this is an open source prototype that I made. What sets it apart is the focus on the business side of the decision making process. The inspiration came from working with some local startups here in HK. I wonder if you see any (upsell) value in this tool, and if so, whether Zerion would like to fund this project?
